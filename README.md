Simple screenshotting service implemented in node using phantom.js.


I wanted to scratch an itch I'd had for a while.  A few years ago I worked for a company that used a screenshotting service.  It always seemed like an easy thing to build ourselves but we never did.  Phantom.js is well up to the task of doing image capture's however this is an imperfect solution since it only outputs to a file so it's less than perfect for a Request/Response service.
